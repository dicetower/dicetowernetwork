                The Little Metal Dog Show began back in April 2010 with an idea to produce a podcast on board games that did things a little
                differently. It took a while to decide the approach that would be taken, but soon an interview-based show quickly became the
                format to stick with. Each episode normally has a couple of interviews that could really cover any area from the world of
                gaming – as long as someone is interesting, they're welcome to come on as a guest. From players and designers to mathematicians
                and film-makers, The Little Metal Dog Show looks far and wide for people who – above all else – have something
                interesting to say.
