                The Little Metal Dog Show began back in April 2010 with an idea to produce a podcast on board games that did things a little
                differently. It took a while to decide the approach that would be taken, but soon an interview-based show quickly became the
                format to stick with. Each episode normally has a couple of interviews that could really cover any area from the world of
                gaming – as long as someone is interesting, they're welcome to come on as a guest. From players and designers to mathematicians
                and film-makers, The Little Metal Dog Show looks far and wide for people who – above all else – have something
                interesting to say.

                Most board game shows focus on the latest and greatest, or time-tested classics...the crew from Flip the Table 
				have taken it upon themselves to review all the rest. They've combed charity shops and salvage stores for cheesy, 
				weird, and obscure board games; licensed cash-grabs, VHS games, bizarre kids' games, and everything else in between. 
				Why would they do this? Because they can...and because examining The Other Side of Board Games is a great way to learn 
				more about what makes board games tick. Join Flip the Table as they suffer for your entertainment. And remember...in Soviet Russia,

                The Long View is a podcast designed to take a closer, more critical look at the games we play. Each episode will focus on a 
				single game. The game will be one that the podcasters will have played many, many times. The purpose is to provide a forum for those 
				who want to know what a game reveals after multiple plays. Discussion will focus on the game play itself. It will not be a description 
				of the rules of the game. Rather, it will be an in depth exploration of the merits or flaws of the game that become apparent when it it 
				played multiple times. Thanks for listening!</p>
