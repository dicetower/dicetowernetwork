                The Little Metal Dog Show began back in April 2010 with an idea to produce a podcast on board games that did things a little
                differently. It took a while to decide the approach that would be taken, but soon an interview-based show quickly became the
                format to stick with. Each episode normally has a couple of interviews that could really cover any area from the world of
                gaming – as long as someone is interesting, they're welcome to come on as a guest. From players and designers to mathematicians
                and film-makers, The Little Metal Dog Show looks far and wide for people who – above all else – have something
                interesting to say.

                The world of tabletop games is a lot bigger than most people realize.  In fact it's so big that the idea of investigating it can actually be 
				kind of intimidating. When you see all those games you've never heard of, with rules and concepts and themes you've never seen before in a game, 
				it's hard to know where to start.</p>
			<p>	
				The answer is: start with the SnakesCast. Every week, we'll bring you ten or fifteen minutes' worth of banter about what makes these 
				games worth playing. With a different theme every episode and a rotating cast of both gurus and non-gurus from Toronto's premiere boardgame café, 
				we'll show you just how much there is to play with out there.
